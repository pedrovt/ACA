Without forwarding
-> Data Hazzards: 2 nops
-> Control Hazzards: 3 nops

With forwarding
-> Data hazzards: either 0 or 1 nop, depends on the sequence of instructions (1 nop if it's a lw then something else)
-> Control hazzards: from 3 nops to 2 nops (distance 2 between EX/MEM and the ID phase)

Professors' version goes from 156 cycles to 102 with forwarding

With branch predictor 
-> Bugs on the simulator, only the static versions work
-> Will gain 1 slot
-> In this situation
	-> Use Predict-Not-Taken (default) -> 102 cycles -> not good, the program has 9 consecutives branch taken, 1 not taken
	-> Use Predict-Taken -> 95 cycles  -> better!!
		- 1 nop is not done per cycle -> 102 - 9*1 = 93 
		- but we got 95??? 
			> bugs on the simulation -> +1 nop
			> last jump done but not supposed -> +1 nop to delete
-> Static Backward Always Taken: if the jump is backwards, assumes it's taken
