From ~1300 cycles, ~620 are effective instructions, the rest is nops!!

with forwarding, 887 cycles, ~620 are effective instructions -> much small impact

but still without branch prediction (by defauly branch not taken)

but branch taken? should be better?
no because we have the if, so compensates the rest

with MIPS compatibiliy mode (ie with Branch Delayed Slot and interlocking), it's even possible to eliminate the nops (with some rearraging of the instructions). around ~30 nops, 5% with branch not taken

with MIPS compatiblity mode and branch taken, results are a bit worse

Static predicition works very well for some programs, for others does not work so well
